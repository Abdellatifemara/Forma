## 1. STANDING POSES

### Overview

Standing poses form the foundation of yoga practice, building strength, stability, and proper alignment. They develop leg strength, improve balance, and create awareness of proper body mechanics. Standing poses are often used as a starting point for beginners and as warm-up poses in more advanced practices.

**Key Principles:**
- Root down through all four corners of the feet (big toe mound, little toe mound, inner heel, outer heel)
- Engage the quadriceps to lift the kneecaps and protect the knee joints
- Maintain a neutral pelvis - avoid excessive anterior or posterior tilt
- Stack joints when possible (ankle under knee, knee under hip)
- Keep the breath flowing - never hold your breath

**General Benefits:**
- Build lower body strength and endurance
- Improve proprioception and balance
- Develop core stability
- Increase stamina and focus
- Prepare the body for more advanced poses

## 7. INVERSIONS

### Overview

Inversions are poses where the head is below the heart. They reverse the effects of gravity, increase blood flow to the brain, and stimulate the lymphatic system. Inversions are considered advanced poses requiring proper preparation and often supervision.

**Key Principles:**
- Build a strong foundation in basic poses first
- Warm up thoroughly before attempting inversions
- Learn with qualified instruction, especially headstand and handstand
- Never force or jerk into inversions
- Come out of inversions slowly to avoid blood pressure changes
- Quality over duration - proper alignment matters most

**General Benefits:**
- Reverse effects of gravity on the body
- Stimulate lymphatic drainage
- Increase blood flow to the brain
- Build core and upper body strength
- Develop focus and overcome fear

**IMPORTANT:** Inversions should be practiced with caution. Learn from a qualified teacher, especially for headstand and handstand.
