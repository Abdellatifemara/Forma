# SECTION 1: PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINES

## Source: WHO 2020 Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour

### Adults (18-64 years)

| Recommendation | Specification |
|----------------|---------------|
| Moderate-intensity aerobic | 150-300 minutes per week |
| Vigorous-intensity aerobic | 75-150 minutes per week |
| Combination option | Equivalent combination throughout week |
| Muscle-strengthening | 2 or more days per week, all major muscle groups |
| For additional benefits | >300 min moderate OR >150 min vigorous weekly |
| Sedentary behavior | Limit time; replace with any intensity activity |
| Minimum bout duration | **REMOVED in 2020** - Any duration counts |

**Key Change from 2010:** Previous requirement for "bouts of at least 10 minutes" was removed. All activity of any duration now counts.

### Older Adults (65+ years)

| Recommendation | Specification |
|----------------|---------------|
| Aerobic activity | Same as adults (150-300 min moderate OR 75-150 min vigorous) |
| Muscle-strengthening | 2 or more days per week |
| Multicomponent activity | 3 or more days per week (balance + strength training) |
| Purpose | Fall prevention, functional capacity |

### Children & Adolescents (5-17 years)

| Recommendation | Specification |
|----------------|---------------|
| Daily activity | At least 60 min/day moderate-to-vigorous, mostly aerobic |
| Vigorous + strength/bone | At least 3 days per week |
| Sedentary | Limit, particularly recreational screen time |

### Pregnant & Postpartum Women

| Recommendation | Specification |
|----------------|---------------|
| Aerobic activity | At least 150 min moderate-intensity throughout week |
| Variety | Aerobic AND muscle-strengthening activities |
| Previously active | Can continue vigorous activities during pregnancy |
| Pelvic floor training | Performed daily (incontinence prevention) |

**Safety Notes:**
- Avoid supine position after first trimester
- Avoid high-altitude/excessive heat activities

### Key Principles

1. **"Some physical activity is better than none"**
2. **"More is generally better, up to a point"** - curvilinear dose-response
3. **"60-75 min/day moderate-to-vigorous can mitigate harms of extended sitting"**

# SECTION 3: PROTEIN INTAKE GUIDELINES

## Source: ISSN Position Stand on Protein and Exercise (2017)

### Daily Protein Requirements

| Goal | Protein Intake | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Muscle building/maintenance | 1.4-2.0 g/kg/day | Sufficient for most exercising individuals |
| During caloric deficit | 2.3-3.1 g/kg/day | To preserve lean mass while losing fat |
| Enhanced fat loss (trained) | >3.0 g/kg/day | May have positive body composition effects |
| Endurance athletes | Focus on carbs (6-10 g/kg/day) | Protein secondary for recovery |

### Per-Meal Protein Dosing

| Population | Per-Meal Dose |
|------------|---------------|
| General recommendation | 0.25 g/kg body weight OR 20-40g absolute |
| Elderly | ~40g per meal (for maximum MPS) |
| Higher suppression of breakdown | ~70g may be beneficial |

### Leucine Requirements

| Recommendation | Amount |
|----------------|--------|
| Per meal | 700-3,000 mg leucine |
| Standalone plateau at rest | ~2g |
| Post-exercise | Up to 3.5g |

**Note:** Leucine alone is insufficient - requires complete EAA profile for sustained muscle protein synthesis.

### Meal Timing & Frequency

| Guideline | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Distribution | Every 3-4 hours across the day |
| Post-exercise window | Benefits extend at least 24 hours |
| Peak sensitivity | Within 5-6 hours post-workout |
| Pre-sleep | 30-40g casein (increases overnight MPS without blocking fat oxidation) |
| Pre-workout | Within 5 hours reduces need for immediate post-workout feeding |

### Protein Quality Hierarchy

| Tier | Sources | Leucine Content |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Highest | Milk proteins (whey/casein) | 9-11% |
| High | Eggs | 8.6% |
| High | Beef | 8% |
| Mid | Rice protein | Similar outcomes at high doses (48g/day) |
| Lower | Soy | Lower BCAA, may inhibit mTOR |
| Lower | Wheat/pea | Requires higher doses (60g+) |

### 14 Core Position Statements (Summary)

1. Exercise + protein synergistic for MPS
2. 1.4-2.0 g/kg/d sufficient for muscle mass
3. 2.3-3.1 g/kg/d during caloric deficit
4. >3.0 g/kg/d may enhance fat loss in trained individuals
5. 0.25 g/kg per serving OR 20-40g absolute
6. 700-3,000 mg leucine + balanced EAAs per dose
7. Distribute every 3-4 hours daily
8. Timing flexible; pre- or post-workout both beneficial
9. Supplementation practical for meeting targets
10. Rapid EAA-rich proteins most effective for MPS
11. Protein type/quality affects bioavailability
12. Prioritize whole foods with all EAAs
13. Endurance: adequate carbs primary, protein for recovery
14. Pre-sleep casein (30-40g) increases overnight MPS
