## 1. Understanding Mobility

### What is Mobility?

Mobility is the ability to move a joint actively through its full range of motion (ROM) with control. It combines:
- **Flexibility:** Passive range of motion (muscle length)
- **Strength:** Active control through the range
- **Motor Control:** Coordination and body awareness

### Mobility vs. Flexibility

| Aspect | Flexibility | Mobility |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Definition** | Passive range of motion | Active, controlled range of motion |
| **Example** | Someone pulling your leg into a stretch | You actively lifting your leg to the same position |
| **Training** | Static stretching, passive holds | Dynamic movements, controlled end-range work |
| **Goal** | Increase muscle/tissue length | Functional movement quality |

### Why Mobility Matters

1. **Injury Prevention:** Adequate mobility reduces compensation patterns
2. **Performance:** Better movement quality improves exercise efficiency
3. **Pain Reduction:** Many chronic pains stem from mobility restrictions
4. **Daily Function:** Activities like squatting, reaching, and walking require mobility
5. **Longevity:** Maintaining mobility supports healthy aging

### The Joint-by-Joint Approach

The body alternates between joints that need mobility and stability:

| Joint | Primary Need |
|-------|--------------|
| Ankle | Mobility |
| Knee | Stability |
| Hip | Mobility |
| Lumbar Spine | Stability |
| Thoracic Spine | Mobility |
| Scapula/Shoulder | Stability + Mobility |
| Cervical Spine | Stability |
| Wrist | Stability + Mobility |

When a joint lacks its primary need, adjacent joints compensate. Example: Limited hip mobility often causes lower back pain.

## 2. Hip Mobility

### Overview

The hips are ball-and-socket joints capable of significant movement in all planes. Limited hip mobility affects squatting, walking, running, and causes the lower back, knees, and pelvis to compensate.

**Hip Movements to Train:**
- Flexion (bringing knee toward chest)
- Extension (leg moving behind body)
- Abduction (leg moving away from midline)
- Adduction (leg moving toward midline)
- Internal Rotation (rotating thigh inward)
- External Rotation (rotating thigh outward)

**Normal Ranges (approximate):**
| Movement | Normal ROM |
|----------|------------|
| Flexion | 110-120° |
| Extension | 10-30° |
| Abduction | 30-50° |
| Adduction | 20-30° |
| Internal Rotation | 30-40° |
| External Rotation | 40-60° |

### 90/90 Stretch (Shinbox)

**Target:** Hip internal rotation (back leg), external rotation (front leg), hip flexors, glutes

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Difficulty** | Intermediate |
| **Hold Time** | 30-90 seconds per side |
| **Sets** | 2-3 per side |

**Detailed Technique:**
1. Sit on the floor with both knees bent at approximately 90 degrees
2. Position front leg so the outer shin and outer thigh rest on the floor (external rotation)
3. Position back leg so the inner shin and inner thigh rest on the floor (internal rotation)
4. Stack your torso upright directly over your hips
5. Option 1: Stay upright, focusing on getting both knees to touch the floor
6. Option 2: Hinge forward over the front leg with a flat back
7. Option 3: Hinge back toward the back leg
8. Keep the pelvis level and avoid lifting the opposite hip

**Alignment Cues:**
- Both sit bones should ideally stay on the ground
- Front knee at 90 degrees (not acute angle)
- Spine remains long and neutral
- Avoid rotating the pelvis to compensate
- Breathe into tight areas

**Common Mistakes:**
- Letting opposite hip lift off the ground
- Knee angle less than 90 degrees
- Rounding the spine when hinging
- Forcing the position with hands
- Holding breath

**Progressions:**
- *Easier:* Sit on a yoga block or cushion
- *Easier:* Use hands behind you for support
- *Harder:* Transition between sides without hands (90/90 switches)
- *Harder:* Lean further forward over front leg
- *Harder:* CARs (Controlled Articular Rotations) from this position

**Contraindications:**
- Acute knee pain

- If hip is floating, use a block or blanket underneath
- Flex the front foot slightly to protect the knee

**Common Mistakes:**
- Hips not squared (back hip rotates open)
- Front foot behind back hip (creates torque on knee)
- Collapsing into the stretch without engagement
- Compressing the lower back
- Forcing depth before ready

**Progressions:**
- *Easier:* Figure-4/Supine Pigeon (lying on back)
- *Easier:* Block under front hip for support

### Frog Stretch (Mandukasana)

**Target:** Hip adductors (inner thighs), groin, pelvic floor

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Difficulty** | Intermediate-Advanced |
| **Hold Time** | 30-90 seconds |
| **Sets** | 2-3 |

**Detailed Technique:**
1. Start on hands and knees
2. Slowly spread knees apart, wider than hip-width
3. Turn feet outward so the inside edges rest on the floor
4. Keep knees bent at 90 degrees (shins parallel)
5. Sink hips back and down toward the floor
6. Keep spine neutral, core slightly engaged
7. Option: Lower onto forearms for deeper stretch
8. Control the depth by how far back you push your hips

**Alignment Cues:**
- Knees and ankles should form a straight line
- Shins stay parallel to each other
- Hips sink between knees, not behind them
- Keep lumbar spine neutral (not overarched)
- Toes point outward, not back

**Common Mistakes:**
- Knees sliding forward (losing 90-degree angle)
- Feet rolling in (not keeping inner edge on floor)
- Excessive lumbar extension
- Going too deep too fast
- Holding tension in shoulders

**Progressions:**

### Hip Flexor Lunge Stretch (Low Lunge)

**Target:** Hip flexors (psoas, iliacus, rectus femoris), quadriceps

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |
| **Hold Time** | 30-60 seconds per side |
| **Sets** | 2-3 per side |

**Detailed Technique:**
1. Start in a half-kneeling position (one knee down, one foot forward)
2. Position front foot so knee is directly over ankle
3. Tuck your pelvis under by engaging glutes (posterior pelvic tilt)
4. This alone should create a stretch in the back leg's hip flexor
5. Shift weight forward slightly, maintaining the pelvic tuck
6. Keep torso upright and tall
7. Option: Raise same-side arm overhead and lean away from the kneeling leg

**Alignment Cues:**
- Front knee tracks over second toe
- Back knee directly under hip (or slightly behind)
- CRITICAL: Maintain posterior pelvic tilt throughout
- Squeeze the glute of the back leg to deepen stretch
- Ribs stay down (don't flare)

**Common Mistakes:**
- Anterior pelvic tilt (arching the lower back) - this KILLS the stretch
- Front knee pushing past toes
- Collapsing through the torso
- Shifting weight too far forward
- Not engaging the glute of the back leg

**Progressions:**
- *Easier:* Hands on front thigh for support
- *Easier:* Pad under back knee
- *Harder:* Raise arm overhead on the kneeling side
- *Harder:* Add lateral lean away from kneeling leg
- *Harder:* Elevate back foot on bench (couch stretch)

**Why Pelvic Tilt Matters:**
The psoas attaches to the lumbar spine. If you arch your back (anterior pelvic tilt), you shorten the psoas origin and reduce the stretch. The posterior pelvic tilt is ESSENTIAL for effectively stretching the hip flexor.

**Contraindications:**
- Acute knee pain (pad knee, modify position)
- Recent hip replacement

4. Keep heels on the ground (this is the goal)
5. Use elbows to gently press knees outward
6. Keep chest up and spine as neutral as possible
7. Hands can press together at heart center
8. Breathe deeply, relaxing into the position

**Alignment Cues:**
- Weight distributed across entire foot (not just toes)
- Knees track over toes (not caving in)

| **Reps** | 3-5 circles per direction per hip |
| **Sets** | 1-2 |

**Detailed Technique:**
1. Start on all fours (quadruped position)
2. Lift one knee off the ground slightly
3. Begin by driving knee forward toward chest (flexion)
4. Without pausing, rotate knee out to the side (abduction + external rotation)
5. Continue circling the knee back behind you (extension)
6. Rotate knee inward to return to start (internal rotation)
7. Make the largest circle possible while maintaining control
8. Reverse direction after completing reps

**Alignment Cues:**
- Keep the hips and spine completely still
- All movement comes from the hip joint only
- Move slowly and deliberately (3-5 seconds per circle)
- Create maximal tension throughout the movement
- "Irradiate" tension from the core outward

**Common Mistakes:**
- Moving the spine/pelvis to create a bigger circle
- Moving too quickly
- Not creating tension (just flopping through motion)
- Skipping parts of the circle (especially internal rotation)
- Holding breath

**Progressions:**
- *Easier:* Reduce size of circles
- *Easier:* Standing version holding wall
- *Harder:* Create more tension (irradiation)
- *Harder:* Increase size of circles
- *Harder:* Slow down (10 seconds per circle)

**Purpose of CARs:**
CARs train the nervous system to maintain control throughout the full range of motion. They also serve as a daily "check-in" to assess joint health - if a movement becomes painful or restricted, it indicates a potential problem before injury occurs.

- Extension (arm behind body)
- Abduction (arm out to side)
- Adduction (arm across body)
- Internal Rotation (hand rotates toward body)
- External Rotation (hand rotates away from body)
- Horizontal Abduction/Adduction

**Normal Ranges (approximate):**
| Movement | Normal ROM |
|----------|------------|
| Flexion | 150-180° |
| Extension | 40-60° |
| Abduction | 150-180° |
| External Rotation | 70-90° |
| Internal Rotation | 60-90° |
| Horizontal Adduction | 30-45° |

1. Hold a PVC pipe, broomstick, or resistance band with an overhand grip
2. Start with grip very wide (wider than shoulder width)
3. Begin with the implement in front of thighs, arms straight
4. Keeping arms straight, lift the implement overhead
5. Continue the arc, bringing it behind your body to your lower back
6. Reverse the motion, returning to starting position
7. Keep elbows completely locked throughout
8. Gradually narrow grip over time as mobility improves

**Alignment Cues:**
- Arms MUST stay completely straight

### Wall Slides (Wall Angels)

**Target:** Scapular control, thoracic extension, external rotation, upper trap relaxation

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Difficulty** | Beginner-Intermediate |
| **Reps** | 10-15 |
| **Sets** | 2-3 |

**Detailed Technique:**
1. Stand with back flat against wall
2. Walk feet out 6-12 inches from wall
3. Press entire spine against wall (slight knee bend helps)
4. Place arms in "W" position: elbows at 90 degrees, arms at shoulder height
5. Press backs of hands, wrists, elbows, and shoulders against wall
6. Slowly slide arms up toward "Y" position
7. Maintain ALL points of contact throughout the slide
8. Return to "W" position with control

**Alignment Cues:**
- Head, upper back, and lower back all touch wall
- Flatten lower back by tucking pelvis slightly
- Maintain wrist/elbow/shoulder contact throughout
- Don't let elbows drift forward as arms raise
- Keep ribs down (don't arch to get arms higher)

**Common Mistakes:**
- Losing wall contact as arms go up
- Arching lower back to compensate
- Elbows lifting off the wall
- Shrugging shoulders toward ears
- Moving too quickly

**Progressions:**
- *Easier:* Forearms only on wall (reduced range)
- *Easier:* Lying supine on floor
- *Harder:* Full range from W to overhead
- *Harder:* Pause at top for 2-3 seconds
- *Harder:* Add light resistance band

**Why This Works:**
Wall slides expose compensation patterns. If you can't keep all contact points on the wall, it reveals mobility restrictions in the thoracic spine, shoulders, or both. This exercise simultaneously assesses AND improves mobility.

## 4. Spine/Thoracic Mobility

### Overview

The thoracic spine (T1-T12) is crucial for upper body movement. Poor thoracic mobility forces compensation from the neck, lower back, and shoulders, increasing injury risk. The thoracic spine should primarily provide ROTATION and EXTENSION.

**Thoracic Spine Movements:**
- Flexion (rounding forward)
- Extension (arching back)
- Rotation (twisting)
- Lateral Flexion (side bending)

**Normal Ranges (approximate):**
| Movement | Normal ROM |
|----------|------------|
| Flexion | 30-40° |
| Extension | 20-25° |
| Rotation | 35-45° per side |
| Lateral Flexion | 25-30° per side |

**Note:** Most people lack thoracic EXTENSION and ROTATION due to sitting and forward posture.

| **Reps** | 5-10 extensions per segment |
| **Time** | 2-3 minutes total |

**Detailed Technique:**
1. Place foam roller perpendicular to your spine at mid-back level
2. Lie back with roller supporting the thoracic spine
3. Interlace fingers behind head to support the neck
4. Plant feet flat on floor, knees bent
5. Let hips drop slightly as you extend back over the roller
6. Keep core slightly engaged to protect lower back
7. Roll up or down to different thoracic segments and repeat
8. Focus on segments that feel stiff

**Alignment Cues:**
- Roller stays in the thoracic region (not lower back!)
- Support neck with hands (don't let head hang back)
- Hips stay relatively low (don't bridge up high)
- Control the movement (don't just flop back)
- Breathe as you extend

**Common Mistakes:**
- Placing roller on lower back (this hyperextends lumbar spine)
- Not supporting the neck
- Arching too aggressively
- Moving too quickly
- Bridging hips too high

**Progressions:**
- *Easier:* Smaller extension range
- *Easier:* Softer foam roller
- *Harder:* Arms extended overhead during extension
- *Harder:* Combine with rotation
- *Harder:* Harder/denser foam roller

**Contraindications:**
- Osteoporosis (avoid direct spinal pressure)
- Recent spinal fracture
- Disc herniation (may aggravate)

### Quadruped Thoracic Rotation

**Target:** Thoracic rotation isolated from lumbar spine

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Difficulty** | Intermediate |
| **Reps** | 10-15 per side |
| **Sets** | 2-3 |

**Detailed Technique:**
1. Start on hands and knees
2. Place one hand behind your head (elbow bent)
3. Keep the other hand firmly on the ground
4. Begin with the bent elbow pointing down toward the grounded arm
5. Rotate the thoracic spine, lifting that elbow toward the ceiling
6. Follow your elbow with your gaze
7. Rotate as far as possible while keeping hips still
8. Return to starting position with control

**Alignment Cues:**
- Hips stay completely square to the ground
- Movement comes ONLY from the thoracic spine

- Reach elbow toward ceiling at top of movement
- Exhale as you rotate open

**Common Mistakes:**
- Letting hips rotate with the movement
- Rotating from the lumbar spine
- Moving the supporting arm
- Not rotating far enough
- Moving too fast

**Progressions:**
- *Easier:* Reduce range of motion
- *Easier:* Hand on lower back instead of head
- *Harder:* Hold at top for 2-3 seconds
- *Harder:* Add light weight behind head
- *Harder:* Combine with thread the needle

## 5. Ankle Mobility

### Overview

Limited ankle dorsiflexion (ability to pull toes toward shin) affects squat depth, walking mechanics, and can lead to compensatory issues in the knees, hips, and back. The minimum for a proper squat is typically 15-20 degrees of dorsiflexion.

**Ankle Movements:**
- Dorsiflexion (toes toward shin)
- Plantarflexion (pointing toes)
- Inversion (sole turns inward)
- Eversion (sole turns outward)

**Normal Ranges:**
| Movement | Normal ROM |
|----------|------------|
| Dorsiflexion | 10-20° |
| Plantarflexion | 40-55° |
| Inversion | 35-40° |
| Eversion | 15-20° |

**Assessment:** In the knee-to-wall test, you should be able to touch your knee to the wall with your toes 4-5 inches away.

---

### Knee-to-Wall Mobilization

**Target:** Ankle dorsiflexion, anterior talocrural joint, calf complex

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |
| **Reps** | 10-15 per side |
| **Sets** | 2-3 |

**Detailed Technique:**
1. Stand facing a wall, place one foot about 2 inches from the wall
2. Keep heel firmly planted on the ground
3. Drive your knee forward toward the wall, keeping heel down
4. Touch your knee to the wall while maintaining heel contact
5. If successful, move foot further from wall and repeat
6. Find the maximum distance where you can touch knee to wall with heel down
7. Work at that challenging distance

**Alignment Cues:**
- Heel MUST stay on the ground (this is non-negotiable)
- Knee tracks over second/third toe
- Keep hips squared to the wall
- Avoid letting knee collapse inward
- Lean entire body forward slightly

**Common Mistakes:**
- Heel lifting off the ground
- Knee caving inward
- Only bending at the knee (not driving knee forward)
- Moving too quickly
- Foot turned excessively outward

**Progressions:**
- *Easier:* Start closer to the wall
- *Easier:* Hold onto wall for balance
- *Harder:* Move foot further from wall
- *Harder:* Add oscillations at end range
- *Harder:* Add band distraction (see below)

**How to Track Progress:**
Measure the distance from toe to wall when you can barely touch your knee to the wall. 4-5 inches is a good goal for most people. Track this measurement over time.

---

### Banded Ankle Distraction

**Target:** Talocrural joint mobility, ankle dorsiflexion

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Difficulty** | Intermediate |
| **Reps** | 10-15 per side |
| **Sets** | 2-3 |

**Detailed Technique:**
1. Anchor a thick resistance band at ground level to something sturdy
2. Loop band around the front of your ankle (just below the joint)
3. Step away from anchor point to create significant tension in the band
4. Get into a half-kneeling position with banded foot forward
5. The band should be pulling your ankle backward
6. Drive your knee forward over your toes while keeping heel down
7. The band creates a "joint distraction" that helps mobilize the joint
8. Oscillate gently at the end range

**Alignment Cues:**
- Band sits in the crease where foot meets leg
- Band pulls backward (posteriorly)
- Heel stays firmly on the ground
- Knee tracks over toes
- Create enough band tension to feel the distraction

**Common Mistakes:**
- Band too high on the leg (should be at ankle crease)
- Not enough band tension
- Heel lifting
- Knee caving inward
- Not actually driving knee forward

**Progressions:**
- *Easier:* Less band tension
- *Easier:* Reduce range of motion
- *Harder:* More band tension
- *Harder:* Add oscillations
- *Harder:* Pause at end range for 2-3 seconds

**Why This Works:**
The talus bone often gets stuck in a forward position, limiting dorsiflexion. The band pulls the talus backward, creating space for proper joint mechanics.

---

### Calf Stretches (Gastrocnemius & Soleus)

**Target:** Gastrocnemius (straight leg), Soleus (bent leg), Achilles tendon

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |
| **Hold Time** | 30-60 seconds each position |
| **Sets** | 2-3 per muscle per leg |

**Gastrocnemius Stretch (Upper Calf):**
1. Stand facing a wall, one foot back
2. Keep back leg STRAIGHT, heel down
3. Lean into the wall, keeping back leg straight
4. Feel the stretch in the upper calf

**Soleus Stretch (Lower Calf):**
1. Same position as above
2. BEND the back knee slightly while keeping heel down
3. This takes the gastrocnemius out of the stretch and targets the soleus
4. Feel the stretch in the lower calf/Achilles region

**Alignment Cues:**
- Both heels stay on the ground
- Toes point forward (not turned out)
- Keep back knee locked for gastroc, bent for soleus
- Lean from the hips (don't round the back)
- Front knee bends as needed

**Common Mistakes:**
- Back heel lifting
- Toes turned out
- Not differentiating between gastroc (straight) and soleus (bent)
- Not holding long enough
- Bouncing

**Why Both Muscles Matter:**
The gastrocnemius crosses the knee AND the ankle. It's stretched with a straight knee. The soleus only crosses the ankle and is stretched with a bent knee. BOTH limit dorsiflexion if tight.

---

### Ankle CARs (Controlled Articular Rotations)

**Target:** Entire ankle joint capsule, all directions of ankle movement

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |
| **Reps** | 5-10 circles per direction per ankle |
| **Sets** | 1-2 |

**Detailed Technique:**
1. Sit with one leg crossed over the other, or seated with foot off the ground
2. Hold the lower leg stable with your hands
3. Begin by pointing the toes as hard as possible (plantarflexion)
4. Roll to the outside of the foot (inversion)
5. Pull toes toward shin (dorsiflexion)
6. Roll to inside of the foot (eversion)
7. Complete a full circle at the ankle joint
8. Make circles as large as possible with control
9. Reverse direction

**Alignment Cues:**
- All movement comes from the ankle, not the knee
- Move slowly and deliberately
- Create tension throughout the movement
- Explore the entire range
- Keep the lower leg completely still

**Common Mistakes:**
- Moving from the knee or hip
- Going too fast
- Skipping parts of the range (especially dorsiflexion)
- Not creating tension
- Making tiny circles

---

**Normal Ranges:**
| Movement | Normal ROM |
|----------|------------|
| Flexion | 60-80° |
| Extension | 60-75° |
| Radial Deviation | 15-20° |
| Ulnar Deviation | 30-40° |

---

4. Rock back to starting position
5. Gradually increase how far forward you rock

**Position 2 - Fingers Backward:**
1. Turn hands so fingers point toward knees
2. Rock back toward your heels
3. This stretches the wrist in the opposite direction

**Position 3 - Fingers Out:**
1. Turn hands so fingers point outward (away from each other)
2. Rock side to side

**Alignment Cues:**
- Keep arms straight
- Move slowly and controlled
- Only rock as far as comfortable

- Moving too fast

**Progressions:**
- *Easier:* Less weight on hands (stay back)
- *Easier:* On fists instead of flat hands
- *Harder:* Rock further into end range
- *Harder:* Hold end position
- *Harder:* Lift knees off ground (plank position rocks)

---

### Wrist CARs

**Target:** Entire wrist joint capsule

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |
| **Reps** | 5-10 per direction per wrist |
| **Sets** | 1-2 |

**Detailed Technique:**
1. Extend one arm in front of you
2. Use the other hand to stabilize the forearm (just below the wrist)
3. Begin by flexing the wrist (palm toward forearm)
4. Roll into ulnar deviation (pinky toward forearm)
5. Continue into extension (back of hand toward forearm)

- Forearm stays completely still
- Move slowly (3-5 seconds per circle)
- Make the biggest possible circle
- Create tension throughout

---

## 7. Neck/Cervical Mobility

### Overview

The cervical spine should primarily be stable, but adequate mobility is essential for daily function. Limited neck mobility often compensates for poor thoracic mobility.

**Neck Movements:**
- Flexion (chin to chest)
- Extension (looking up)
- Rotation (looking side to side)
- Lateral Flexion (ear to shoulder)

**Normal Ranges:**
| Movement | Normal ROM |
|----------|------------|
| Flexion | 45-50° |
| Extension | 45-75° |
| Rotation | 60-80° per side |
| Lateral Flexion | 45° per side |

**Important:** Neck exercises should be gentle. Never force through pain or use aggressive stretching.

---

### Chin Tucks

**Target:** Deep neck flexors, cervical posture, forward head correction

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |
| **Reps** | 10-15 |
| **Sets** | 2-3 |

**Detailed Technique:**
1. Can be performed seated, standing, or lying down
2. Start with neutral head position
3. Draw your chin straight back (as if making a double chin)
4. Don't tilt your head up or down - just retract horizontally
5. Imagine the back of your head moving backward
6. Hold for 3-5 seconds
7. Release and repeat

**Alignment Cues:**
- Think "sliding head backward on a shelf"
- Keep eyes level (don't look up or down)
- Feel a gentle stretch at the base of the skull
- Ears should move backward
- Should NOT feel like nodding

**Common Mistakes:**
- Tilting head down (nodding)
- Tilting head up (looking at ceiling)
- Not retracting far enough
- Tensing shoulders
- Holding breath

**Why This Works:**
Forward head posture (common from phone/computer use) weakens the deep neck flexors and tightens the suboccipitals. Chin tucks train these muscles to hold proper cervical alignment.

---

### Neck Rotations

**Target:** Cervical rotation, sternocleidomastoid, upper trapezius

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |

**Detailed Technique:**
1. Sit or stand with good posture
2. Perform a chin tuck first to set neutral position
3. Slowly rotate head to one side
4. Turn until you feel a gentle stretch
5. Hold and breathe
6. Return to center and repeat on other side

**Alignment Cues:**
- Keep chin level (don't tilt up or down)
- Maintain the chin tuck as you rotate
- Shoulders stay relaxed and level
- Don't force the range
- Move slowly and smoothly

**Common Mistakes:**
- Tilting head during rotation
- Lifting the shoulder on the rotating side
- Moving too quickly
- Forcing through discomfort
- Losing the chin tuck position

---

### Upper Trapezius Stretch

**Detailed Technique:**
1. Sit or stand with good posture
2. Reach right hand down toward the floor (or hold onto a chair)
3. Tilt head toward left shoulder (ear toward shoulder)
4. Keep shoulders down and relaxed
5. Option: Use left hand to gently assist the stretch (very gentle pressure)
6. Feel the stretch along right side of neck
7. Hold and breathe

**Alignment Cues:**
- Opposite shoulder stays DOWN
- Pure lateral flexion (don't rotate head)
- Gentle assistance only (don't force)
- Keep face pointing forward
- Breathe normally

**Common Mistakes:**
- Raising the opposite shoulder
- Adding rotation
- Pulling too hard with hand

## 10. General Guidelines

### Frequency

- Perform mobility exercises **daily** or at minimum **3-4 times per week**
- CARs can be done every day as a joint health practice
- Consistency is more important than duration

### Timing

| Timing | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Morning** | CARs, gentle mobility to reduce stiffness |
| **Pre-Workout** | Dynamic mobility, activation work |
| **Post-Workout** | Longer holds, deeper stretches |
| **Evening** | Recovery, relaxation-focused mobility |

### Intensity Guidelines

**Discomfort vs. Pain:**
- Acceptable: Mild discomfort, stretch sensation (4-6/10)
- Not acceptable: Sharp pain, burning, numbness (stop immediately)

**RPE Scale for Mobility:**
| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1-3 | Light stretch, barely noticeable |
| 4-6 | Moderate stretch, comfortable hold |
| 7-8 | Intense stretch, challenging to maintain |
| 9-10 | Too intense, not sustainable |

Work mostly in the 4-6 range, occasionally venturing to 7-8.

### Progression Principles

1. **Increase range before load**
2. **Master passive before active**
3. **Earn the right to progress**
4. **Consistency beats intensity**
5. **Track your baselines**

### Expected Timeline

| Timeframe | Expected Changes |
|-----------|------------------|
| Week 1-2 | Improved body awareness, reduced acute stiffness |
| Week 3-4 | Noticeable increases in range of motion |
| Week 6-8 | Significant mobility improvements |
| Week 12+ | Substantial, sustainable changes |
| Ongoing | Maintenance required to retain gains |

### Safety Guidelines

1. **Never force through sharp pain**
2. **Warm up before deep stretching**
3. **Breathe deeply** (exhale into deeper stretches)
4. **Maintain proper alignment**
5. **Progress gradually**
6. **Stop if you feel dizziness or numbness**
