| Light cardio (bike/treadmill/rowing) | 3-5 min | Elevate heart rate, increase blood flow |

### Phase 2: Dynamic Mobility (5-7 min)
| Exercise | Reps | Target |
|----------|------|--------|
| Arm circles | 10 each direction | Shoulder warmup |
| Leg swings (front-back) | 10 each leg | Hip flexors, hamstrings |
| Leg swings (side-side) | 10 each leg | Hip adductors/abductors |

### Phase 3: Movement-Specific Warmup

- Begin working sets

**Never skip warmup.** Cold muscles are more prone to injury.

## 4-Week Progression Model

| Week | Focus | RPE | Weight/Rep Strategy |
|------|-------|-----|---------------------|
| Week 1 | Form mastery | 6-7 | Use light weight, perfect every rep |
| Week 2 | Rep building | 7 | Same weight, add 1-2 reps per set |
| Week 3 | Load increase | 7-8 | Add 5 lbs to compounds when hitting top reps |
| Week 4 | Deload | 6 | Reduce weight 40%, maintain reps |

### Progression Rules
1. **Form first, always.** Never add weight if form breaks down
2. **Double progression:** Hit top of rep range → add weight → rebuild reps
3. **Small jumps:** 2.5-5 lbs upper body, 5-10 lbs lower body
4. **Compound first:** Progress main lifts before isolations
5. **Patience:** Beginners can add weight almost every session early on

## Injury Adaptations

### Shoulder Pain
- Replace barbell bench with DB or neutral grip
- Avoid behind-neck movements
- More external rotation work (face pulls)
- Check pressing form and shoulder blade position

### Knee Pain
- Check squat depth and form
- Try box squats first
- Replace leg extension with leg curl focus
- Ensure proper warmup

### Lower Back Pain
- Replace barbell squat with goblet squat
- Use leg press instead of deadlifts temporarily
- Add more core work (bird dogs, dead bugs)
- Check hip hinge form

### General Rule
**Pain ≠ Gain.** Sharp pain during exercise = stop. Modify the movement, reduce load, or substitute. See a professional if pain persists.

## FAQs for Beginners

**Q: How do I know if I'm using enough weight?**
A: RPE 7 means you could do 3 more reps with good form. If you hit 15 reps easily when the target is 8-10, add weight.

**Q: What if I miss a workout?**
A: Do it the next day if possible. Don't double up sessions. Just continue the schedule.

**Q: Should I be sore?**
A: Some soreness (DOMS) is normal, especially early. Severe soreness that affects daily life means you did too much.

**Q: When do I move to a more advanced program?**
A: After 3-6 months of consistent progress when you can no longer add weight every session.
