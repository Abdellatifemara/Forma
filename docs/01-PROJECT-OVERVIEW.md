# FitApp - Project Overview

## Vision

FitApp is an AI-powered fitness and nutrition platform built for the Egyptian market, featuring a trainer marketplace that connects certified fitness professionals with clients seeking personalized guidance.

## Core Concept

Unlike global fitness apps with Western food databases, FitApp offers:
- **Egyptian-first nutrition database** with local ingredients and cuisines
- **Equipment-adaptive workouts** from bodyweight to full gym
- **Trainer marketplace** connecting verified coaches with premium clients
- **Offline-first architecture** with all core data stored locally
- **Health integration** with visual graphs trainers can view

## Registration Requirement

**All users must register to use the app.** No guest access.

At signup, user chooses:
- **"Join as Client"** → Normal client flow
- **"Join as Trainer"** → Requires verification, gets automatic Premium
