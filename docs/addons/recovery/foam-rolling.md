# Foam Rolling Guide

## Foam Rolling Basics

### How It Works
- Self-myofascial release (SMR)
- Releases muscle tension
- Improves blood flow
- Reduces muscle soreness
- Increases ROM temporarily

### Guidelines

|-----------|---------|
| Pressure | Moderate (4-7/10 discomfort) |
| Duration | 30-60 seconds per area |
| Speed | Slow, controlled rolls |
| Frequency | Daily or pre/post workout |
