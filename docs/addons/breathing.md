# Breathing Techniques

## Why Breathing Matters for Fitness
- Improves oxygen delivery to muscles
- Enhances recovery between sets
- Reduces stress and cortisol
- Improves core stability (bracing)
- Better sleep = better recovery

## Breathing Patterns

### Diaphragmatic Breathing
**How to:**
1. Lie on back or sit comfortably
2. Hand on chest, hand on belly
3. Breathe into belly (belly rises)
4. Chest stays relatively still
5. Exhale slowly, belly falls

**Practice:** 5 minutes daily

### Box Breathing (4-4-4-4)
**Steps:**
1. Inhale for 4 seconds
2. Hold for 4 seconds
3. Exhale for 4 seconds
4. Hold empty for 4 seconds
5. Repeat 4-8 rounds

**Use for:** Pre-workout focus, stress relief, between sets

### 4-7-8 Breathing
**Steps:**
1. Inhale through nose for 4 seconds
2. Hold for 7 seconds
3. Exhale through mouth for 8 seconds
4. Repeat 4 cycles

**Use for:** Relaxation, before sleep, anxiety

### Physiological Sigh
**Steps:**
1. Double inhale through nose (big breath + small top-up)
2. Long slow exhale through mouth
3. Repeat 2-3 times

**Use for:** Quick calm-down, between heavy sets

## Breathing for Lifting

### Valsalva Maneuver
**For heavy compound lifts:**
1. Take deep breath into belly
2. Brace core (like bracing for punch)
3. Hold breath during lift
4. Exhale at top or sticking point
5. Reset breath between reps

**When:** Squats, deadlifts, bench press, rows (heavy sets)

### Rhythmic Breathing
**For moderate weights/accessories:**
1. Exhale on exertion (lifting phase)
2. Inhale on lowering phase
3. Continuous rhythm

**Example bench press:**
- Inhale: Lower bar to chest
- Exhale: Press bar up

**Example squat:**
- Inhale: Standing position
- Brace: During descent
- Exhale: Coming up from bottom

### Core Bracing
**Steps:**
1. Deep breath into belly (360° expansion)
2. Tighten abs like bracing for punch
3. Keep tension throughout movement
4. Don't let belly push out—keep tight

**Practice:** Plank holds with focused breathing

## Breathing for Cardio

### Running/Cycling
| Intensity | Pattern | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Easy | 3:3 | 3 steps inhale, 3 exhale |
| Moderate | 2:2 | 2 steps inhale, 2 exhale |
| Hard | 2:1 | 2 steps inhale, 1 exhale |
| Sprint | Natural | Don't overthink |

### HIIT Intervals
- During work: Rhythmic, don't hold breath
- During rest: Deep controlled breaths
- Use physiological sigh for quick recovery

## Recovery Breathing

### Post-Workout (5 min)
| Minute | Technique |
|--------|-----------|
| 1-2 | Normal breathing, slow down |
| 3-4 | Box breathing (4-4-4-4) |
| 5 | Deep belly breaths |

### Before Sleep
1. 4-7-8 breathing (4 cycles)
2. Body scan with breathing
3. Slow exhale focus

## Breathing Routines

### Morning Energizing (3 min)
| # | Technique | Duration |
|---|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Deep belly breaths | 1 min |
| 2 | Box breathing | 1 min |
| 3 | Energizing breaths (quick in/out) | 30s |
| 4 | Normal breathing | 30s |

### Pre-Workout Focus (2 min)
1. 5 deep belly breaths
2. 4 rounds box breathing
3. 2-3 physiological sighs
4. Ready to train

### Stress Relief (5 min)
1. 4-7-8 breathing (4 rounds)
2. Box breathing (4 rounds)
3. Normal slow breathing
4. Physiological sigh to close

## Common Mistakes
| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Chest breathing | Focus on belly expansion |
| Holding breath (accessories) | Match breath to movement |
| Shallow breathing | Practice diaphragmatic daily |
| Breathing too fast during rest | Slow, controlled breaths |
| Not bracing on heavy lifts | Practice bracing separately |
