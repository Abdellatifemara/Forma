# Balance & Stability Training

## Overview

Balance and stability training improves proprioception, reduces injury risk, enhances athletic performance, and maintains functional independence. These exercises challenge the body's ability to maintain equilibrium under various conditions.

---

## The Science of Balance

### Three Sensory Systems
1. **Visual System** - Eyes detect orientation and movement
2. **Vestibular System** - Inner ear detects head position and acceleration
3. **Proprioceptive System** - Receptors in muscles/joints sense body position

### Types of Balance
- **Static Balance**: Maintaining position while stationary
- **Dynamic Balance**: Maintaining equilibrium during movement
- **Reactive Balance**: Recovering from unexpected perturbations

### Why Balance Degrades
- Aging (proprioceptor decline)
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Injury/surgery
- Neurological conditions
- Lack of challenge/practice

## BALANCE FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

### Older Adults (Fall Prevention)
- Focus on BAL001, BAL012, BAL013, BAL016 (with support nearby)
- Progress slowly, always have support available
- Include sit-to-stand practice
- Daily practice recommended

### Post-Ankle Sprain
- Progress: BAL021 → BAL020 → BAL014 → BAL016
- Single-leg stance is key
- Proprioceptive retraining essential
- Wobble board when ready

### Post-ACL Surgery
- Coordinate with physical therapist
- BAL001 → BAL004 → BAL011
- Single-leg hops when cleared
- Dynamic balance before return to sport

### Athletes
- All exercises appropriate
- Focus on reactive (BAL048-52)
- Sport-specific movement patterns
- High-level challenge needed

## PROGRAMMING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Beginner Balance Program
**Weeks 1-4**:
- Single-leg stand: 30 sec each leg

## COMMON MISTAKES IN BALANCE TRAINING

1. **Progressing too fast** - Master basics before advancing
2. **Always using support** - Challenge yourself appropriately
3. **Looking down** - Eyes forward for vestibular engagement
4. **Breath holding** - Breathe normally throughout
5. **Avoiding challenge** - Some wobble is the point
6. **Ignoring core** - Core engagement is fundamental
7. **Skipping dynamic balance** - Static alone isn't enough
8. **No consistency** - Balance requires regular practice

---

## SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

- Always have support nearby initially
- Use spotters for unstable surface work
- Clear area of obstacles
- Appropriate footwear (or barefoot if safe)
- Don't train balance when fatigued
- Progress based on ability, not timeline
- Stop if dizzy or experiencing vertigo
