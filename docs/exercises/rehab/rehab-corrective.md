# Rehabilitation & Corrective Exercises

## Overview

Corrective exercises address muscle imbalances, postural dysfunctions, and movement pattern issues. These exercises are used in injury prevention, rehabilitation, and performance optimization.

**Important**: For actual injury rehabilitation, always consult a qualified healthcare professional (physical therapist, sports medicine doctor).

## PROGRAMMING RECOMMENDATIONS

### General Principles
1. **Address root causes**, not just symptoms
2. **Consistency over intensity** - daily corrective work beats occasional intense sessions
3. **Progress gradually** - master basics before advancing
4. **Integrate corrections** into regular training
5. **Reassess periodically** to track improvement

### Sample Corrective Routine (Upper Crossed Syndrome)
**Daily (5-10 minutes)**:
1. Chin tucks: 10 reps, hold 10 seconds
2. Thoracic extension on roller: 15 reps, 2-3 positions
3. Pec doorway stretch: 30 seconds each side
4. Wall angels: 10 reps
5. Prone Y-T-W: 10 reps each position

### Sample Corrective Routine (Lower Crossed Syndrome)
**Daily (10-15 minutes)**:
1. Hip flexor stretch with PPT: 60 seconds each side
2. Glute bridge with PPT: 15 reps
3. Dead bug: 10 each side
4. Bird dog: 10 each side
5. McGill curl-up: 10 reps, 10-second holds

### Post-Knee Injury Protocol
**Phase 1 (Days 1-7)**: Quad sets, SLR, gentle ROM
**Phase 2 (Week 2-4)**: TKE, short arc quad, mini squats
**Phase 3 (Week 4-8)**: Step-ups, lunges, single-leg work
**Phase 4 (Week 8+)**: Full activity progression

*Always follow healthcare provider guidelines for specific injuries*

### Integration with Training
- Perform correctives in warm-up
- Address specific weaknesses between sets
- Use as cool-down/recovery work
- Dedicated corrective sessions 2-3x/week for significant issues
