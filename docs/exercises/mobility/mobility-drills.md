# Complete Mobility Drills Database

## Overview

Mobility is the ability to move a joint actively through its full range of motion with control. Unlike passive stretching, mobility drills emphasize active control, joint health, and movement quality.

### Mobility vs Flexibility
- **Flexibility**: Passive range of motion (how far you can be stretched)
- **Mobility**: Active range of motion (how far you can move with control)
- **Goal**: Convert flexibility into usable mobility

### Benefits of Mobility Training
- Improved joint health and longevity
- Better movement quality in all exercises
- Reduced injury risk
- Enhanced athletic performance
- Less joint stiffness and pain
- Better posture

## Controlled Articular Rotations (CARs)

CARs are the foundation of mobility training. They involve moving each joint through its full range of motion with maximal tension and control.

### Hip CARs

#### MD001 - Standing Hip CAR

## Progressive Mobility System

### Phase 1: CARs Only (Weeks 1-2)

- 10-15 minutes per day
- Build control through range

### Phase 3: Add PAILs/RAILs (Weeks 5-8)
- CARs + active drills + PAILs/RAILs for limitations
- 15-20 minutes per day
- Progressive overload for mobility gains

### Phase 4: Maintenance (Ongoing)
- Daily CARs (5 min)
- 2-3x/week focused sessions (15-20 min)
- Address limitations as needed
