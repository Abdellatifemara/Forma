# Foam Rolling Database - FitApp

## Overview

Foam rolling (self-myofascial release) helps reduce muscle tension, improve blood flow, and enhance recovery. This database covers foam rolling techniques for every major body part with proper form, common mistakes, and programming recommendations.

**Equipment Options:**
- Standard foam roller (soft/medium/firm)
- Textured/grid foam roller
- Vibrating foam roller
- Lacrosse ball / massage ball
- Tennis ball (softer option)
- Peanut ball (for spine)

**General Guidelines:**
- Roll slowly: 1-2 inches per second
- Spend 30-90 seconds per muscle group
- Breathe deeply and relax into the pressure
- Avoid rolling directly on bones or joints
- Stop if you feel sharp pain (not discomfort)
- Best used: pre-workout (light), post-workout (thorough), recovery days
