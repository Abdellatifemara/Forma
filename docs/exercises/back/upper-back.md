# Upper Back Exercises - Traps & Rhomboids (80+ Movements)

## Anatomy

### Trapezius (Traps)
The trapezius is a large diamond-shaped muscle with three distinct regions:
- **Upper Traps**: Elevates scapula (shoulder shrug)
- **Middle Traps**: Retracts scapula (pull together)
- **Lower Traps**: Depresses and upwardly rotates scapula

### Rhomboids
Located between the spine and scapulae:
- **Rhomboid Major**: Retracts and downwardly rotates scapula
- **Rhomboid Minor**: Same functions, smaller and superior

### Functions
- **Scapular retraction**: Pulling shoulder blades together
- **Scapular elevation**: Shrugging shoulders up
- **Scapular depression**: Pulling shoulders down
- **Postural support**: Maintaining upright posture

## Key Training Principles

1. **Elevation vs Retraction**: Different trap regions need different movements
2. **Squeeze at top**: Hold contraction for 1-2 seconds
3. **No rolling**: Shrugs should go straight up, not circular
4. **Posture work daily**: Face pulls and band work can be done daily
5. **Balance pushing and pulling**: 2:1 pull to push ratio for posture

## Common Mistakes
| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Rolling shoulders on shrugs | Ineffective, injury risk | Straight up and down |
| Too heavy on shrugs | Reduced ROM | Lighter, full ROM |
| Neglecting lower traps | Posture issues | Y raises, face pulls |
| Upright rows too narrow | Shoulder impingement | Wide grip or avoid |
| No pause at contraction | Less muscle activation | 1-2 sec squeeze |

## Programming Recommendations
| Goal | Sets/Week | Rep Range | Rest |
|------|-----------|-----------|------|
| Size (upper traps) | 8-12 | 8-15 | 60-90s |
| Posture/Health | 10-15 | 15-25 | 30-60s |
| Strength | 6-10 | 5-8 | 2-3 min |

**Optimal Weekly Volume:** 10-15 sets for upper back (traps/rhomboids)

## Posture Protocol
Do daily for posture correction:
1. Band face pulls - 2x20
2. Band pull-aparts - 2x20
3. Wall slides - 2x10
4. Prone Y-T-W - 1x10 each
