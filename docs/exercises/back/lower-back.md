# Lower Back Exercises - Erector Spinae (70+ Movements)

## Anatomy

### Erector Spinae Group
Three parallel columns running along the spine:

**Spinalis** (Medial/Inner)
- Closest to spine
- Extends from upper lumbar to mid-thoracic
- Primary spinal extension

**Longissimus** (Middle)
- Largest of the three
- Runs entire length of spine
- Primary extender and rotator

**Iliocostalis** (Lateral/Outer)
- Most lateral column
- Attaches to ribs
- Lateral flexion and extension

### Quadratus Lumborum (QL)
- Deep muscle connecting pelvis to lower spine
- Lateral flexion and hip hiking
- Common source of lower back pain

### Functions
- **Spinal extension**: Straightening/arching the back
- **Eccentric control**: Braking forward bending
- **Lateral flexion**: Side bending
- **Spinal stabilization**: Maintaining neutral spine
- **Posture maintenance**: Keeping upright position

## Key Training Principles

1. **Neutral spine always**: Never round under load
2. **Hip hinge mastery**: Learn with bodyweight first
3. **Brace before lifting**: Valsalva maneuver for heavy loads
4. **Progress slowly**: Lower back recovers slower than other muscles
5. **Balance with core work**: Abs and lower back work together

## Common Mistakes
| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Rounding lower back | Disc injury risk | Keep chest up, brace core |
| Hyperextending at top | Spinal compression | Neutral lockout with glutes |
| Too much too soon | Injury | Progressive overload carefully |
| Neglecting mobility | Limited ROM, pain | Daily hip flexor stretches |
| Not bracing | Spinal instability | Deep breath, engage core |

## Programming Recommendations
| Goal | Sets/Week | Rep Range | Rest |
|------|-----------|-----------|------|
| Strength | 6-10 | 3-6 | 3-5 min |
| Hypertrophy | 10-15 | 8-12 | 90-120s |
| Endurance/Health | 8-12 | 15-25 | 60s |

**Optimal Weekly Volume:** 8-12 direct sets for lower back (note: deadlifts and rows also hit erectors)

## Safety Warning

⚠️ **Lower back training requires caution:**
- Always warm up thoroughly
- Never train through pain
- If you have disc issues, consult a professional
- Learn hip hinge pattern before loading
- Start lighter than you think necessary
