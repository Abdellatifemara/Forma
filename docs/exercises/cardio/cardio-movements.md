# Cardio & Conditioning Movements

## Overview

Cardiovascular exercise improves heart health, endurance, and metabolic function. This database covers low-impact to high-intensity movements for all fitness levels.

---

## Cardio Training Principles

### Energy Systems
- **Aerobic**: Uses oxygen, sustainable for long durations (walking, jogging)
- **Anaerobic Glycolytic**: 30 seconds to 2 minutes of intense work (sprints)
- **Phosphagen/ATP-CP**: Explosive efforts under 10 seconds (max sprints)

### Heart Rate Zones
| Zone | Intensity | % Max HR | Purpose |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Very Light | 50-60% | Recovery, warm-up |
| 2 | Light | 60-70% | Fat burning, endurance base |
| 3 | Moderate | 70-80% | Aerobic capacity |
| 4 | Hard | 80-90% | Lactate threshold |
| 5 | Maximum | 90-100% | VO2 max, speed |

**Max HR Estimate**: 220 - age (or 208 - 0.7 × age for better accuracy)

## PROGRAMMING RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Fat Loss
- Mix Zone 2 steady state (60-70% HR) with HIIT
- 3-5 cardio sessions per week
- Include variety to prevent adaptation
- Example week:
  - Day 1: 30 min steady jog
  - Day 2: 20 min HIIT (burpees, mountain climbers)
  - Day 3: Rest
  - Day 4: 30 min row or bike
  - Day 5: Combat cardio 20 min
  - Day 6: Active recovery (water jogging)
  - Day 7: Rest

### For Conditioning (Athletic Performance)
- Focus on sport-specific movements
- Interval training 2-3x per week
- Maintain aerobic base
- Example:
  - Day 1: Hill sprints
  - Day 2: Steady state 30 min
  - Day 3: Agility work (lateral shuffle, carioca)
  - Day 4: Rest
  - Day 5: Battle ropes + sled work
  - Day 6: Easy jog or swim
  - Day 7: Rest

### For Heart Health
- Prioritize Zone 2 training
- 150+ minutes moderate intensity per week
- Low-impact options for joint preservation
- Example:
  - 5x 30 min sessions: walking, cycling, swimming, rowing, stair climber

### For Beginners
- Start with low-impact options
- Build to 20-30 minutes continuous
- Progress intensity gradually
- Weeks 1-4: Walking, marching, step touch
- Weeks 5-8: Add low-impact jacks, boxer shuffle
- Weeks 9+: Introduce higher intensity as tolerated

## COMMON MISTAKES IN CARDIO TRAINING

1. **Too much too soon** - Progress gradually
2. **Ignoring form** - Fatigue shouldn't compromise technique
3. **Same routine forever** - Vary modalities and intensities
4. **Neglecting recovery** - Rest days are essential
5. **All high-intensity** - Balance with Zone 2 work
6. **Skipping warm-up** - 5-10 minutes minimum
7. **Poor breathing** - Learn to breathe rhythmically
8. **Ignoring pain** - Differentiate discomfort from injury
