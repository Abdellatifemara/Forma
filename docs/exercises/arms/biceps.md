# Biceps Exercises (80+ Movements)

## Anatomy
- **Long head**: Outer bicep, creates the "peak" when flexed
- **Short head**: Inner bicep, adds thickness and width
- **Brachialis**: Lies under biceps, pushes bicep up for bigger arm appearance
- **Brachioradialis**: Forearm muscle involved in hammer grip movements

## Key Training Principles

1. **Full ROM**: Full stretch at bottom, full squeeze at top
2. **Control the negative**: 2-3 second eccentric for growth
3. **Wrist position**: Supinated (palm up) for peak bicep activation
4. **Elbow position**: Keep elbows fixed (slight forward drift OK)
5. **Mind-muscle**: Squeeze at top contraction

## Common Mistakes
| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Swinging/momentum | Reduces bicep tension | Strict form, wall support |
| Partial reps | Misses stretched position | Full ROM always |
| Too heavy | Cheating, ego lifting | Drop weight, feel muscle |
| Elbow drift | Turns into front raise | Pin elbows at sides |
| No variety | Limited development | Include all angles |

## Programming Recommendations
| Goal | Sets/Week | Rep Range | Rest |
|------|-----------|-----------|------|
| Strength | 6-8 | 4-6 | 2-3 min |
| Hypertrophy | 10-16 | 8-12 | 60-90s |
| Endurance | 12-20 | 15-25 | 30-45s |

**Optimal Weekly Volume:** 10-20 direct sets for biceps (note: chin-ups and rows also hit biceps)
