# Complete Resistance Band Exercise Database

## Overview

Resistance bands provide variable resistance training - getting harder as they stretch. They're portable, affordable, and offer unique training benefits.

- **Loop bands** (mini bands): Great for glute work, warm-ups
- **Long loop bands**: Pull-up assistance, stretching, full body
- **Tube bands with handles**: Traditional exercises, easy to grip

### Benefits of Band Training

- Portable and affordable
- Great for warm-up/activation
- Accommodates all strength levels
- Horizontal resistance (unlike gravity)
