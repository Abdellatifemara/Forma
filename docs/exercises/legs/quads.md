# Quadriceps Exercises (100+ Movements)

## Anatomy
The quadriceps femoris is a group of four muscles on the front of the thigh:

- **Rectus Femoris**: Crosses both hip and knee (hip flexion + knee extension)
- **Vastus Lateralis**: Outer quad (lateral), largest quad muscle
- **Vastus Medialis**: Inner quad (medial), "teardrop" muscle
- **Vastus Intermedius**: Deep middle, under rectus femoris

### Function
- **Primary**: Knee extension
- **Secondary**: Hip flexion (rectus femoris only)
- **Stabilization**: Knee joint stability, patellar tracking
