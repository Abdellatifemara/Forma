## Anatomy Overview

### The Three Hamstring Muscles
| Muscle | Origin | Insertion | Function |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Biceps Femoris (Long Head)** | Ischial tuberosity (sit bone) | Head of fibula | Hip extension, knee flexion, external rotation of lower leg |
| **Biceps Femoris (Short Head)** | Linea aspera of femur | Head of fibula | Knee flexion only (no hip extension!) |
| **Semimembranosus** | Ischial tuberosity | Medial tibial condyle | Hip extension, knee flexion, internal rotation of lower leg |
| **Semitendinosus** | Ischial tuberosity | Pes anserinus (medial tibia) | Hip extension, knee flexion, internal rotation of lower leg |

### Key Points for Complete Development
1. **Long head vs short head** - Short head only crosses knee (need leg curls to target it)
2. **Hip extension exercises** - Train hamstrings in lengthened position (RDL, good mornings)
3. **Knee flexion exercises** - Train hamstrings in shortened position (leg curls)
4. **Both movement patterns needed** - For complete development, do BOTH types

### Hamstring Function Summary
| Function | Exercises |
|----------|-----------|
| Hip Extension | RDL, stiff-leg deadlift, good morning, hip thrust |
| Knee Flexion | Leg curls (lying, seated, standing) |
| Both Functions | Nordic curl, glute-ham raise |

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| Rounding back on RDL | Spinal load, injury risk | Keep chest up, engage lats |
| Going too deep with rounded back | Disc injury risk | Stop when back wants to round |
| Knees bending too much | Becomes a squat, less hamstring | Keep slight fixed bend |
| Only doing leg curls | Misses hip extension function | Add RDLs, good mornings |
| Only doing hip hinges | Misses knee flexion function | Add leg curls |
| Ego lifting on RDL | Poor form, injury | Go lighter, feel the stretch |
| Skipping Nordic curls | Miss best injury prevention exercise | Start with assisted version |

## Injury Prevention Protocol

### The Nordic Curl Protocol
Research shows Nordic curls reduce hamstring injuries by 50-70%:

**Week 1-2:** 2 sets x 5 reps (assisted)
**Week 3-4:** 3 sets x 6 reps (assisted)
**Week 5-8:** 3 sets x 6 reps (less assistance)
**Week 9+:** 3-4 sets x 4-6 reps (unassisted)

Perform 2-3x/week, ideally not before intense running/sprinting.

### Hamstring-to-Quad Ratio
For injury prevention, ensure:
- Hamstring strength = ~60% of quad strength
- Most lifters are hamstring-weak
- Add extra hamstring volume if ratio is off
