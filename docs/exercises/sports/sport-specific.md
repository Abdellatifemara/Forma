# Sport-Specific Training Exercises

## Overview

Sport-specific training develops the physical qualities and movement patterns required for athletic performance. These exercises target the unique demands of each sport while building transferable fitness qualities.

## Training Principles for Athletes

### Specificity Principle
- Exercises should mimic sport demands (speed, direction, energy systems)
- Movement patterns should transfer to competition
- Train the relevant energy systems

### Periodization
- Off-season: Build general fitness base
- Pre-season: Develop sport-specific qualities
- In-season: Maintain while managing fatigue
- Post-season: Recovery and address weaknesses

### Movement Planes in Sport
- **Sagittal**: Forward/backward movement (running, cycling)
- **Frontal**: Side-to-side movement (lateral shuffles, cutting)
- **Transverse**: Rotational movement (throwing, swinging)
