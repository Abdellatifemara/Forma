# Pelvic Floor & Kegel Exercises (30+ Movements)

## Anatomy
The pelvic floor is a group of muscles that form a hammock-like structure at the base of the pelvis.

### Key Muscles
- **Pubococcygeus (PC)**: Main kegel muscle, controls urine flow
- **Iliococcygeus**: Supports pelvic organs
- **Puborectalis**: Controls bowel movements
- **Coccygeus**: Supports coccyx, assists with hip stability
- **External anal sphincter**: Voluntary bowel control
- **Urethral sphincter**: Bladder control

### Functions
- Supports pelvic organs (bladder, uterus/prostate, rectum)
- Controls urination and bowel movements
- Sexual function and pleasure
- Core stability (part of the "inner unit")
- Breathing coordination
- Spinal support

## How to Find Your Pelvic Floor

### For Everyone
1. **Urination test**: Try to stop the flow of urine mid-stream (only for identification, don't do regularly)
2. **Gas test**: Imagine stopping gas from passing
3. **Internal lift**: Feel like you're drawing up your pelvic floor toward your head

### Visual Cue
- Imagine picking up a marble with your pelvic floor
- Think of drawing a jellyfish up through water
- Imagine closing an elevator door and lifting the elevator

## Integration with Lifting

### During Compound Lifts
1. **Setup**: Engage pelvic floor as part of bracing
2. **Brace sequence**: Breath in → engage PF → engage core → lift
3. **Exhale**: Maintain some PF tension through lift
4. **Reset**: Full breath and PF relaxation between reps

### Exercises That Benefit Most
- Squats
- Deadlifts
- Overhead press
- Any heavy compound movement

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Holding breath | Creates too much pressure | Breathe normally |
| Squeezing glutes/abs | Wrong muscles | Isolate PF first |
| Only contracting, never relaxing | Hypertonic PF | Include PF031-035 |
| Bearing down instead of lifting | Wrong direction | "Lift" don't "push" |
| Doing during urination regularly | Bladder dysfunction | Only use to find muscle |
