# Deep Core & TVA Exercises - Complete Database

## Anatomy Overview

### Transverse Abdominis (TVA)
- **Origin**: Iliac crest, inguinal ligament, thoracolumbar fascia, internal surfaces of lower 6 ribs
- **Insertion**: Linea alba, pubic crest
- **Function**: Compresses abdominal contents, increases intra-abdominal pressure, stabilizes spine
- **Key Feature**: Deepest abdominal muscle - acts like a natural weight belt

### Multifidus
- **Origin**: Sacrum, posterior superior iliac spine, mammillary processes of lumbar vertebrae, transverse processes of thoracic vertebrae
- **Insertion**: Spinous processes of vertebrae 2-4 levels above
- **Function**: Extends and rotates spine, primary spinal stabilizer
- **Key Feature**: Most important muscle for preventing lower back pain

### Diaphragm
- **Origin**: Xiphoid process, lower 6 ribs, upper lumbar vertebrae
- **Insertion**: Central tendon
- **Function**: Primary breathing muscle, creates intra-abdominal pressure for core bracing
- **Key Feature**: Works with TVA and pelvic floor to create "abdominal canister"

### Quadratus Lumborum (QL)
- **Origin**: Iliac crest, iliolumbar ligament
- **Insertion**: 12th rib, transverse processes of L1-L4
- **Function**: Lateral flexion of spine, hip hiking, spinal stabilization
- **Key Feature**: Often tight/overactive - balance strengthening with stretching

### Pelvic Floor Integration
- Deep core function requires coordination of TVA, multifidus, diaphragm, and pelvic floor
- These muscles work together as a "pressure system"
- Dysfunction in one affects all others

- **Primary**: Diaphragm
- **Secondary**: TVA, pelvic floor
- **Contraindications**: None
- **Form Cues**:
  - Lie on back with knees bent, one hand on chest, one on belly
  - Breathe into belly - bottom hand should rise, top hand stays still
  - Exhale slowly through pursed lips, feeling belly fall
  - 360-degree expansion into floor, not just belly rising
- **Common Mistakes**:
  - Chest rising instead of belly → Focus on belly expansion
  - Shallow breathing → Slow down, 4-count inhale

## Form Guides & Common Mistakes

### The "Abdominal Brace" Technique
1. **Not sucking in** - Brace like expecting a punch
2. **360-degree activation** - Expand all around, not just front
3. **Maintain normal breathing** - Don't hold breath
4. **Use on all exercises** - Squats, deadlifts, pressing, etc.

### Signs of TVA Weakness
- Lower back pain during activity
- Poor posture (lordosis)
- Belly "pooch" despite being lean
- Difficulty stabilizing during heavy lifts
- Diastasis recti (abdominal separation)

### Common Deep Core Training Mistakes
1. **Only training rectus abdominis** - Need TVA work too
2. **Holding breath** - Learn to breathe while bracing
3. **Going too heavy too fast** - Build endurance first
4. **Neglecting anti-movements** - Anti-extension, anti-rotation matter
5. **Ignoring breathing patterns** - Foundation of core function

| Daily | Breathing drills | 10 breaths each position |

### For Athletes

## Deep Core Training Principles

### The Canister Concept
- Diaphragm (top), TVA (sides), pelvic floor (bottom)
- Must work together for proper function
- Breathing creates the foundation
- Bracing = coordinating all components

### Progression Guidelines
1. **Breathing mastery** - Foundation for everything
2. **Isometric stability** - Holds before movement
3. **Anti-movement** - Resist forces first
4. **Dynamic movement** - Move under load last

### Red Flags (See a Professional)
- Pain during exercises
- Incontinence during training
- Significant diastasis recti
- Chronic lower back pain
- Post-pregnancy core dysfunction

---

**Total: 65 exercises**

*Note: Deep core training is about quality over quantity. Master breathing and basic activation before progressing to advanced exercises. These muscles respond to consistency more than intensity.*
