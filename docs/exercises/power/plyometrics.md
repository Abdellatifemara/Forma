# Complete Plyometrics Database

## Overview

Plyometrics (jump training) develops explosive power, speed, and athleticism through rapid stretch-shortening cycle movements. These exercises train the muscles and nervous system to produce maximum force in minimum time.

### What is the Stretch-Shortening Cycle (SSC)?
1. **Eccentric phase** - Muscle lengthens under load (landing/loading)
2. **Amortization phase** - Brief transition (should be minimal)
3. **Concentric phase** - Explosive contraction (takeoff)

### Benefits of Plyometric Training
- Increased vertical jump
- Faster sprint speed
- Improved agility and change of direction
- Greater power output
- Enhanced athletic performance
- Better neuromuscular coordination

### Prerequisites
- **Strength base**: Squat 1.5x bodyweight recommended
- **Healthy joints**: No knee, ankle, or back issues
- **Proper technique**: Master landing before jumping
- **Progressive approach**: Start low-intensity

---

## Safety Guidelines

### Proper Landing Technique
- Land toe-ball-heel (soft)
- Knees track over toes
- Absorb force through hips
- Quiet landings (not loud)
- Never land with locked knees

### Training Parameters
| Level | Contacts/Session | Intensity |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| Beginner | 40-60 | Low-Medium |
| Intermediate | 80-120 | Medium-High |
| Advanced | 120-200 | High-Maximum |

*Contact = one jump/bound/hop*

### Recovery Requirements
- **48-72 hours** between plyometric sessions
- Quality over quantity
- Stop if form deteriorates
- Don't train plyometrics when fatigued

## Plyometric Training Principles

### Progressive Overload
1. **Increase complexity** - Simple to complex movements
2. **Increase height** - Low to high boxes/hurdles
3. **Decrease ground contact** - Slower to faster reactive
4. **Add load** - Bodyweight to weighted

### Recovery Guidelines
- 48-72 hours between plyometric sessions
- Full recovery between sets
- Never train plyometrics when fatigued
- Quality always beats quantity

### Integration with Strength Training
- **Complex training**: Strength exercise + matching plyo
- **Example**: Squats (5x3) → Box jumps (5x5)
- Potentiates nervous system for power

*Note: Plyometrics are high-stress exercises. Always prioritize proper landing mechanics, adequate recovery, and progressive overload. If you experience joint pain, reduce intensity or volume immediately.*
