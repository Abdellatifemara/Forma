# Calories & Energy Balance

## TDEE Calculation

### Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
**Mifflin-St Jeor Formula:**
- Men: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) + 5
- Women: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) - 161

### Activity Multipliers
| Activity Level | Multiplier | Description |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Sedentary | 1.2 | Desk job, no exercise |
| Light | 1.375 | Light exercise 1-3x/week |
| Moderate | 1.55 | Moderate exercise 3-5x/week |
| Active | 1.725 | Hard exercise 6-7x/week |
| Very Active | 1.9 | Physical job + hard exercise |

### TDEE = BMR × Activity Multiplier

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: Egyptian Male
- Age: 25, Weight: 80kg, Height: 175cm
- Activity: Moderate (gym 4x/week)

BMR = (10 × 80) + (6.25 × 175) - (5 × 25) + 5 = 1,799 kcal
TDEE = 1,799 × 1.55 = **2,788 kcal/day**

### Example 2: Egyptian Female
- Age: 28, Weight: 65kg, Height: 163cm
- Activity: Light (gym 2x/week)

BMR = (10 × 65) + (6.25 × 163) - (5 × 28) - 161 = 1,369 kcal
TDEE = 1,369 × 1.375 = **1,882 kcal/day**

## Calorie Targets by Goal

| Goal | Calorie Adjustment | Rate |
|------|-------------------|------|
| Aggressive Cut | TDEE - 750 | ~0.75 kg/week loss |
| Moderate Cut | TDEE - 500 | ~0.5 kg/week loss |
| Slow Cut | TDEE - 250 | ~0.25 kg/week loss |
| Maintenance | TDEE | Weight stable |
| Lean Bulk | TDEE + 250 | ~0.25 kg/week gain |
| Bulk | TDEE + 500 | ~0.5 kg/week gain |

## Egyptian Food Calorie Reference

### High Calorie (>400 per serving)
| Food | Calories | Serving |
|------|----------|---------|
| Koshari (large) | 800 | 1 plate |
| Fatta | 750 | 1 serving |
| Om Ali | 560 | 1 bowl |
| Molokhia + rice + meat | 600 | Full meal |
| Ful + ta'ameya + bread | 650 | Full breakfast |

### Moderate Calorie (200-400)
| Food | Calories | Serving |
|------|----------|---------|
| Grilled chicken (150g) | 250 | 1 portion |
| Rice (1 cup cooked) | 200 | 1 cup |
| Baladi bread | 200 | 1 loaf |
| Ful medames (no oil) | 230 | 1 cup |
| Lentil soup | 180 | 1 bowl |

### Low Calorie (<200)
| Food | Calories | Serving |
|------|----------|---------|
| Grilled fish (100g) | 120 | 1 fillet |
| Salad (no dressing) | 50 | 1 bowl |
| Cucumber | 15 | 1 medium |
| Tomato | 20 | 1 medium |
| Eggs (boiled) | 78 | 1 large |

## Calorie Tracking Tips

### For Egyptians
1. Measure oil carefully (1 tbsp = 120 cal)
2. Bread adds up fast (each loaf ~200 cal)
3. Rice portions often underestimated
4. Street food usually high calorie
5. Home cooking gives more control

### Common Mistakes
| Mistake | Hidden Calories |
|---------|-----------------|
| "Splash" of oil | 200+ cal |
| Not counting bread | 400+ cal |
| Drinking calories | 300+ cal |
| Finishing kids' food | 200+ cal |
| Tasting while cooking | 100+ cal |

## Weight Change Troubleshooting

### Not Losing Weight?
1. Recalculate TDEE (may have overestimated activity)
2. Track more accurately (weigh food)
3. Cut 200 more calories
4. Increase activity
5. Check for hidden calories

### Not Gaining Weight?
1. Add 200-300 more calories
2. Drink calories (milk, shakes)
3. Eat more frequently
4. Track consistently
5. Prioritize calorie-dense foods
