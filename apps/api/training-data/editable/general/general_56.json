It is capable of producing 9.0+ magnitude earthquakes and tsunamis that could reach 30m (100 ft) along the coast, with strength and intensity decreasing further from the epicenter.

Substitutions can be made between downs, which allows for a great deal of specialization as coaches choose the players best suited for each particular situation. During a play, each team should have no more than 11 players on the field, and each of them has specific tasks assigned for that specific play."
