Each muscle group should be trained 2x per week for optimal growth\n2. Allow 48-72 hours between training the same muscle\n3. Quality > quantity - better to train 3 days intensely than 6 days poorly\n\nStart conservative and add days as your recovery improves."

Full range of motion\n2. Control the eccentric (lowering)\n3. Don't neglect compound movements (bench, rows, pull-ups)\n4. Eat in a slight surplus\n\nArms respond well to higher frequency - hit them 2-3x per week with 10-15 sets total per muscle."

Inconsistency**\n- Missing workouts adds up\n- Weekend eating undoing weekday effort\n- Results require months of consistency\n\n**3. Training Issues**\n- Not enough intensity (too easy)\n- Too much intensity (can't recover)\n- No progressive overload\n- Program hopping\n\n**4. Nutrition Problems**\n- Eating more than you think (not tracking)\n- Not enough protein\n- Wrong calorie target for your goal\n\n**5. Recovery Issues**\n- Not sleeping 7-9 hours\n- High stress\n- Training too frequently\n\n**6. Unrealistic Expectations**\n- Muscle gain: 0.5-1kg per month (beginners)\n- Fat loss: 0.5-1% bodyweight per week\n- Visible changes take 8-12 weeks\n\nWhich of these might apply to you?"
