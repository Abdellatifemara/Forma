Hornby Railways became independent again in the 1980s, and became listed on the London Stock Exchange, but due to financial troubles reported in June 2017, became majority owned by British turnaround specialist Phoenix Asset Management."

It was written in the early 14th century. Allegorically, the poem represents the soul's ascent to God."
