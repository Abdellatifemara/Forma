It was called the \"Tariff of Abominations\" by its Southern detractors because of the effects it had on the Southern economy. It set a 38% tax on some imported goods and a 45% tax on certain imported raw materials."

The tactic was originally used by pirates and privateers to deceive other ships into allowing them to move closer before attacking them.
