        "value": "Lower back pain during deadlifts is common and usually indicates a technique issue. Let me help:\n\n**Common causes:**\n1. **Rounding the lower back** - Most common\n2. **Bar too far from body** - Increases lever arm\n3. **Hips rising too fast** - \"Stripper deadlift\"\n4. **Starting position too low/high**\n5. **Weak core/bracing**\n\n**Immediate steps:**\n1. Stop if there's sharp pain\n2. Reduce weight significantly (50%)\n3. Film yourself from the side\n\n**Form fixes:**\n1. Brace your core HARD before lifting\n2. Keep the bar touching your shins\n3. Push the floor away, don't pull the bar\n4. Chest up, shoulders back\n5. Hips and shoulders rise together\n\n**Alternative exercises while you fix form:**\n- Trap bar deadlifts (easier on lower back)\n- Romanian deadlifts (lighter, focused)\n- Hip hinge drills with dowel\n\n**When to see a professional:**\n- Pain persists beyond a few days\n- Radiating pain down legs\n- Numbness or tingling\n\nWould you like specific cues for any of these fixes?"

        "value": "A proper warm-up prepares your body and reduces injury risk. Here's my protocol:\n\n**Phase 1: General Warm-up (5 min)**\n- Light cardio: rowing, bike, or jump rope\n- Goal: Raise body temperature, increase blood flow\n\n**Phase 2: Dynamic Stretching (5 min)**\n- Leg swings (front/back, side to side)\n- Hip circles\n- Arm circles\n- World's greatest stretch\n- Cat-cow stretches\n- Bodyweight squats\n\n**Phase 3: Movement-Specific Warm-up**\nGradually work up to your working weight:\n\n*Example for 100kg squat:*\n- Empty bar x 10\n- 40kg x 8\n- 60kg x 5\n- 80kg x 3\n- 90kg x 2\n- 100kg (working sets)\n\n**Key principles:**\n1. Never skip the warm-up\n2. Don't fatigue yourself before working sets\n3. Increase weight in ~20% jumps\n4. Reduce reps as weight increases\n5. Rest 1-2 min between warm-up sets\n\nA good warm-up takes 10-15 minutes and is worth every second!"
